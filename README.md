# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project


## Introduction
This repository contains my work for the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data", which is part of the Data Science specialization.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 


## Repository Contents

* tidy_data.txt: a tidy data set ready for later analysis.

* run_analysis.R: a script for performing the analysis to tidy the data and create tidy_data.txt.

* Codebook.md: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed in run_analysis.R.
